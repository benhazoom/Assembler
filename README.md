# Assembler
Assembler for basic assembly in C language

for using the assembler the program should accept an input of assembly files (.asm) so it best be run via terminal.
the program outputs are :
1.'obj' file with machine code DC IC
2.'ent' file for local entries (adresses) and their IC
3.'ext' files for external entries and their IC.

Writting this project took me 1.5 mounts and taught me alot about procedural thinking, how to use and understand complex data infrastructure like union, self-discipline and more.

I really enjoyed writing this project I felt satisfied working on a code of a program that is crucial.
