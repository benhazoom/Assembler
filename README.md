# Assembler
Assembler for basic assembly in C language
This project was a final task in the course "lab in systems programming" written in C language by myself.

desigen for running on Linux by running a command with input assembly files.
the program outputs 'obj' file with machine code DC IC, 'ent' file for local entries (adresses) and their IC and 'ext' files for external entries and their IC.

Writting this project took me 1.5 mounts and taught me alot about procedural thinking how to use and understand complex data infrastructure like union, self-discipline and more.

I really enjoyed writing this project I felt satisfied working on a code which is the crucial for every computer.
